Required python modules: opencv, numpy, pandas

videotrack.py is the script that contains the main tracking function.
Presently the script assumes that the videos are 25 fps and in 1024 X 1280 resolution.
The track_main function takes a cv2 VideoCapture object and various parameters. It should be run from the directory where it resides.
To get a VideoCapture from a video:
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(videofile) where videofile is the path of the video

post_process.py contains functions to get more high-level results out of the data generated by the OCR in videotrack
track_util.py contains assorted utility functions
